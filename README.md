🧠 Computer Vision - Image Classification with PyTorch
This project demonstrates a simple computer vision pipeline using PyTorch and a pre-trained convolutional neural network to classify images. It includes loading an image, preprocessing it, running it through a model, and interpreting the results.

🔍 Features
Load and preprocess input images.

Use a pretrained ResNet model for inference.

Display predicted class label and confidence.

Simple and modular PyTorch-based code.

Works with any image supported by PIL.
